The Odin Project - Etch a Sketch

Development of an in-browser canvas similar to a sketch pad made for The Odin Project - [Foundations](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch).
This exercise uses only HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
Live version can be checked [here](https://thnardg.github.io/etch-a-sketch/).

This project consists of a grid of 20x20, 30x30, or 40x40 squares in which the user can pick a color from a color wheel and create patterns/drawings directly on the browser by clicking and dragging the mouse cursor on the board. There's also a rainbow mode that randomly changes each square's color.

The benefits I got from this project:

    Improved knowledge of DOM manipulation with dinamically created elements.
    Learned how to better work with grid elements.
    Deepened knowledge of DOM events.
    Build on previous knowledge of fuctions and how they interact with each other.
