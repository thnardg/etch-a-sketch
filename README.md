## The Odin Project - Etch a Sketch

Development of an in-browser canvas similar to a sketch pad made for The Odin Project - [Foundations](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch).<br>
This exercise uses only HTML, CSS and JavaScript.<br>
Live version can be checked [here](https://thnardg.github.io/etch-a-sketch/).<br>

This project consists of a grid of 20x20, 30x30, or 40x40 squares in which the user can pick a color from a color wheel and create patterns/drawings directly on the browser by clicking and dragging the mouse cursor on the board. There's also a rainbow mode that randomly changes each square's color.<br>

**The benefits I got from this project:**
- Improved knowledge of DOM manipulation with dinamically created elements.
- Learned how to better work with grid elements.
- Deepened knowledge of DOM events.
- Build on previous knowledge of fuctions and how they interact with each other.
